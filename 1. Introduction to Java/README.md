# The Basics of Java

This section of the .java lessons cover the very basics of Java, with information such as classes, variables, functions, I.e, the basics of basics of programming. If you're already familiar with programming, this section isn't neccessary, however, it might be beneficial to learn the syntax if the language. 

# Overview of Java's Syntax

* ## **[Declaring Variables](https://github.com/prolang-tutorials/.java/blob/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Java/3.%20Data%20in%20a%20Java%20class/3.1_Class_Structure.java)**
    ```java
    String text = "text";
    ```
    Like many other C derived languages, variables in Java require three fundemental aspects. The data type, (in this case a String type), the reference address (the name of the variable, in this case text), and the content of the variable (in this case "text"). Note that the content of any variable can always list to a '**null**' data type. Listed **[here](https://github.com/prolang-tutorials/.java/blob/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Java/3.%20Data%20in%20a%20Java%20class/3.1_Class_Structure.java)** is where I cover the basics of primitive data types.
